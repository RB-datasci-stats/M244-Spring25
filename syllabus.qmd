In this course, we will refine and expand data wrangling, data
visualization, and modeling skills. Additionally, we will continue to
investigate and discuss the impact of data quality in and ethical
implications of data science. As data science combines aspects of
computer science and statistics, this course will be very quantitative
in nature, with a heavy focus on the computational implementation of
data science techniques such as machine learning. Students will get
further practice with the R and Python programming languages. We will
practice using Git for version control and coding collaboration.

This is an intermediate course and therefore assumes some familiarity
with coding and statistics. The prerequisite courses are MATH 240 and
CMPU 100. You are not expected to have an advanced understanding of
statistics and machine learning -- we will focus more on the
implementation and intuition behind intermediate data science
techniques. If you have taken any machine learning courses, this class
may be a bit too elementary for you. If you are not comfortable with R
and Python, you may find this class somewhat difficult. Please feel free
to come chat with me about it if you are unsure!

<hr size="5">

# Course Structure

This class is a mix of lectures and in-class activities. Most in-class
activities will consist of working through labs or tutorials in R or
Python in groups. After the add-drop period ends, I will put you into
groups. You will be in these groups for in-class activities for two
weeks. Then groups will be re-assigned. The purpose behind this is for
you to meet and work with everyone in the class.

Please plan to bring a laptop every class with R and Python installed so
that we can make the most out of class time. If you do not have access
to a laptop, please let me know so we can make alternate arrangements.

## Texts {#texts}

We will use the following textbook:

-   [Introduction to Statistical Learning: with Applications in
    Python](https://www.statlearning.com/) by James, Witten, Hastie,
    Tibshirani, and Taylor (ISLP in Schedule). We will use this book for
    learning about core topics in machine learning.

Please note that there is a version of this book called *Introduction to
Statistical Learning: with Applications in R*, which is the same book
conceptually but with labs in R instead of Python. As we will be using
Python for the machine learning components, I suggest that you download
the Python version.

Please note that the pdf version of this textbook is free! There is no
need to purchase a hard copy unless you want to.

For other topics, there will be readings posted to Moodle and linked in
the schedule.

## Software

There are software requirements for the course. I ***highly recommend***
installing RStudio, R, Python, and Git to your personal computer. This
is a very useful skill. However, I do not want this to be an obstacle
for learning class material. Accessing these software through a server
and web browser is also acceptable. See below for more details on each
one.

### R

We will use R and RStudio throughout this course. You may access both of
these resources on the Vassar College server:

-   For on campus: <http://rstudio.vassar.edu/>

-   Unfortunately, you cannot access the server off campus.

Alternatively (and recommended), you can download and install `R` on
your computer at <http://cran.r-project.org/>, as well as RStudio which
is available at <https://posit.co/download/rstudio-desktop/>. Please
follow the instructions for downloading both here:
<https://moderndive.netlify.app/1-getting-started.html#installing>
(although note that since RStudio has become Posit, the steps for
installing RStudio may be slightly different).

#### Reading More About R

If you want to brush up on your R skills, [*R for Data Science
(2e)*](https://r4ds.hadley.nz/) by Hadley Wickham, Mine
Ã‡etinkaya-Rundel, and Garrett Grolemund is an excellent introduction to
the `tidyverse` approach to R programming.

If you are interested in R as a programming language, feel free to check
out Hadley Wickham's[^1] excellent *Advanced R*. You can access its
contents for free online here: <https://adv-r.hadley.nz/>.

[^1]: Hadley Wickham is a statistician, the creator of the `ggplot2`
    package and the tidyverse, and Chief Scientist at RStudio. He's from
    New Zealand, hence the .nz in the links here and above.

### Python

We will be using Python for the machine learning components of the
course. You should also install Python and Jupyter Notebook on your
computer. There are many ways to do this. One way is to install the
`Anaconda` distribution of Python; it collects a wide array of useful
packages, libraries, and applications that make it possible to use
Python on your own computer. You can install from
<https://www.anaconda.com/products/distribution>. See
<https://docs.anaconda.com/anaconda/install/index.html> for helpful
instructions for different platforms.

#### Reading More About Python

There are many books written about Python. A good place to start is this
[link](https://towardsdatascience.com/5-free-books-for-learning-python-for-data-science-87be443c084),
which collects a list of 5 free books on learning Python.

In particular, [Python for Everybody](https://www.py4e.com/html3/) by
Charles R. Severance is a great resource for those learning to use
Python for data science, and [A Whirlwind Tour of
Python](https://jakevdp.github.io/WhirlwindTourOfPython/index.html) by
Jake VanderPlas is a great introduction to Python in general; it serves
as a necessary prerequisite to his [Python Data Science
Handbook](https://jakevdp.github.io/PythonDataScienceHandbook/).

### Git

You also need to install Git. Please follow the instructions at this
link to do so:
<http://rafalab.dfci.harvard.edu/dsbook/accessing-the-terminal-and-installing-git.html>.
A helpful resource for using Git is the [ProGit online
book](https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2).

You will also need to make a Github account, if you have not done so.
Please see here for instructions:
<https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/signing-up-for-github/signing-up-for-a-new-github-account>.
We will use Github Classroom (look for a sign-up link in the first week
of class) to make using Git a bit easier.

We will set-up Git together during the first lab so there is no need to
do it before then.

## Course Communication

All course materials---including slides, worksheets, assignments, and
other course resources---will be posted on the class Moodle. The Moodle
page will either direct you to this course website or to the Google
drive that contains the raw files you might want to download. Course
communication will otherwise occur via our M 244 Slack workspace. In
particular, I ask that you please not email me with course-related
questions, but rather post these questions in the appropriate Slack
channel. If discretion is needed, please feel free to direct message me
on Slack.

*During the week, I will try my best to answer all Slack messages within
24 hours of receiving them. However, if you message me over the weekend
or holidays, I may not respond to your message until classes resume in
an effort to maintain my own work-life balance. Please plan
accordingly.*

## Assignments and Evaluation

### Engagement (5%)

Statistics is best learned through doing! Please come to class ready to
discuss and engage with the course material. You should keep a *course
notebook* that contains materials from class along with notes you take
from the textbook. Every Monday, you will submit a *course check-in*.
This will be a Google form on what you learned in class last week.
Specifically, it will ask you to:

1.  Describe the main topic in your own words

2.  Write down the most important thing that you learned.

3.  Write two questions you have about the material.

I expect you to attend class, be actively engaged, and ask
questions---in class, during office hours, and on the course Slack---and
to contribute towards answering the questions of others. If you are
unable to attend class, please let me know in advance so we can make
arrangements.

### Extra Credit Opportunity

Throughout the course, you can earn up to a maximum of 12 extra credit
points. Six of these points can be added to your lowest homework or
essay score. The other six can be added to your project score. You can
earn points through any of the following engagement activities:

-   1 point for every question asked on the `#questions` Slack channel.

-   1 point for every question answered on the `#questions` Slack
    channel.

-   2 points for every math, statistics, or data science talk you
    attend.

-   4 points for participating in DataFest (April 11-13)

-   2 points for completing the course evaluation.

You will keep track of your own extra credit points and let me know how
many you earned at the end of the semester.

### Homework (25%)

There will be five homework assignments that will generally be due on
Thursdays at 11:59 PM. These problem sets will ask you to demonstrate
and grow your conceptual understanding of data science. Homework will be
submitted as pdfs on Gradescope and will be graded for correctness,
neatness, and clarity.

In order to encourage the reading of feedback and growth/improvement,
you will have the opportunity to revise and re-submit *one* problem once
it has been graded.

### Labs (15%)

There will be labs roughly once a week. We will start lab assignments in
class that will have you apply topics from that week. You will often
work on a lab with your group. You may need to finish these labs outside
of class. The lab assignment will be submitted as a pdf to Gradescope by
11:59 PM the following Monday. Note that every individual must submit a
lab. Labs are graded on completion. In order to earn full completion
points, you must answer each question with your best effort, and format
it properly (e.g. if the question involved coding, the code should be
presented in a code chunk). We will talk more about the format of labs
as the semester progresses.

### Short Essays (15%)

During the semester you will write several short essays. These will be
graded for correctness, neatness, and clarity. You will complete most of
these essays outside of class and one or two during class.

### Project (35%)

The class has a capstone final project for which students, working in
groups, conduct and present an original data analysis on a dataset of
your choice.

The aim of the project is for you to apply concepts and techniques we
will cover in this course. You can use an existing dataset or collect
your own data.

You will be able to form your own groups for the project. Please keep in
mind that each group member will get the same grade on project
components. When deciding on groups, I encourage you to think about the
time commitments and motivations each person has for being in the class
and working on the project. If you cannot form a group, I will put you
in one.

The project consists of the following components (in parentheses is
weight of that component's grade in the overall project grade):

1.  Proposal (5%)
2.  Exploratory Data Analysis (7.5%)
3.  Peer Review of Preliminary Analysis (15%)
4.  Presentation (30%)
5.  Report (30%)
6.  Team member evaluation (2.5%)
7.  GitHub Repo (10%)

At the end of the project, you will evaluate your own and your group
members' contribution to the project.

More information will be provided about the project and the individual
components later in the semester.

## Grade Breakdown

Final grades will be weighted as follows:

|              |     |
|--------------|-----|
| Engagement   | 5%  |
| Homework     | 25% |
| Labs         | 20% |
| Short Essays | 15% |
| Project      | 35% |

I will use the following grading scale:

-   A: 100-92; A-: \< 92-90
-   B+: \< 90-87; B: \< 87-82; B-: \< 82-80
-   C+ \< 80-77; C: \< 77-72; C-: \< 72-70
-   D+: \< 70-67; D: \< 67-60
-   F: \< 60

Due to the extra credit opportunity, **I will not do any rounding.**

# Class Policies

## Class Norms

I expect that we all hold ourselves to the following five standards:

1.  Treat others with the dignity and respect you would like to receive.

2.  Embrace productive struggle and making mistakes, and have grace for
    the mistakes of others.

3.  Ask questions to deepen your understanding, and ask for help when
    you need it.

4.  Participate to the best of your ability.

5.  Prioritize your health and well-being.

## Collaboration {#latework}

Data science is in many ways a team sport! I strongly encourage you to
form study groups and to work together to complete your homework and lab
assignments. However, I also ask that you take ownership over your work
in this course. Collaborating involves sharing ideas and/or working on
the problem solving aspects together, and then writing up answers or
code *individually.* If the code or work that you turn in is modeled
after something you found online or received help on by a peer, please
cite this source. We will talk more about collaboration and academic
integrity throughout the course.

## Generative AI

Generative AI such as ChatGPT can be a powerful tool for helping you to
write and debug code. With this new form of technology, we are still
learning the pros and cons of its use. If you use generative AI on an
assignment, please acknowledge this and write a sentence or two on your
interactions and how useful you found it. This will help us all better
understand its pros and cons.

Please be aware that generative AI is designed to mimic human language -
not to output the truth. You should always double check if the output
from generative AI makes sense. Furthermore, be careful to not rely on
generative AI too heavily. After all, generative AI is not necessary for
successfully completing this course.

# Resources for Students

## Q-Center Peer Support Services

This course fulfills the quantitative analysis (QA) requirement for
graduation. All Vassar students have access to free, drop-in,
peer-to-peer quantitative tutoring at the Quantitative Reasoning Center
(Q-Center). Quantitative tutors (Q-Tutors) excel in a variety of STEM
courses. They are typically available Sunday-Thursday 3pm-11pm while
classes are in session. Q-Tutors who specialize in Mathematics and
Physics are located in the Main Library, Room 122 behind the Writing
Center. Q-Tutors who specialize in Chemistry and Economics are located
in the Main Library, Room 88 near Special Collections. If you have a
quantitative question beyond these four disciplines, Q-Tutors are
available to attempt to help you with this question or will help direct
you to someone else who may be better able to help. Schedules and other
important information can be found at
<https://offices.vassar.edu/ltrc/qrc/>.

## Academic Accomodations

Academic accommodations are available for students registered with the
[Office for Accessibility and Educational
Opportunity](https://offices.vassar.edu/accessibility-and-educational-opportunity/)
(AEO). Students in need of disability (ADA/504) accommodations should
schedule an appointment with me early in the semester to discuss any
accommodations for this course that have been approved by the Office for
Accessibility and Educational Opportunity, as indicated in your AEO
accommodation letter.

## Title IX Resources

Vassar College is committed to providing a safe learning environment for
all students that is free of all forms of discrimination and sexual
harassment, including sexual assault, domestic violence, dating
violence, and stalking. If you (or someone you know) has experienced or
experiences any of these incidents, know that you are not alone. Vassar
College has staff members trained to support you in navigating campus
life, accessing health and counseling services, providing academic and
housing accommodations, helping with legal protective orders, and more.

Please be aware all Vassar faculty members are "responsible employees,"
which means that if you tell me about a situation involving sexual
harassment, sexual assault, dating violence, domestic violence, or
stalking, I must share that information with the Title IX Coordinator.
Although I have to make that notification, you will control how your
case will be handled, including whether or not you wish to pursue a
formal complaint. Our goal is to make sure you are aware of the range of
options available to you and have access to the resources you need.

If you wish to speak to someone privately, you can contact any of the
following on-campus resources:
